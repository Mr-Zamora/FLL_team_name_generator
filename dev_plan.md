# FLL Team Name Generator - Development Plan

## Project Overview
The FLL Team Name Generator is a Flask web application designed to help FIRST LEGO League teams generate, manage, and vote on team names for the 2025-2026 UNEARTHED season. The application provides both automated name generation and custom name submission capabilities.

## Current Features
- Team name generation using word combinations system
- Batch generation of multiple names (20 at a time)
- Voting system for team members to select favorites
- Custom name submission
- Data backup system for name storage
- Responsive web interface

- **app.py**: Main Flask application with routes and API endpoints
- **name_generator.py**: Core name generation logic
- **templates/**: HTML templates for the web interface
  - **base.html**: Base template with common layout
  - **index.html**: Main landing page
  - **batch.html**: Batch name generation page
  - **vote.html**: Voting interface
- **static/**: CSS, JavaScript, and image assets
- **data/**: JSON data files including word components and saved names
