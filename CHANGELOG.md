### Initial Implementation

#### Project Setup
- Created basic project structure with directories for templates, static assets, and data
- Added `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies:
  - Flask 2.3.3
  - google-generativeai 0.3.1
  - Werkzeug 2.3.7
  - Jinja2 3.1.2
  - MarkupSafe 2.1.3
  - itsdangerous 2.1.2
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `product_requirements_document.md` to specify the use of `config.py` for configuration
- Updated `functional_specification.md` to document security approach using `config.py`
- Updated `gemini_prompt_engineering.md` to include configuration details

#### Backend Implementation
- Created main Flask application (`app.py`) with the following features:
  - Core routes for welcome, generation, and voting screens
  - API endpoints for name generation, saving, voting, and custom name addition
  - Integration with Gemini API for AI-powered name generation
  - JSON-based data persistence with automatic file creation
  - Error handling and fallback mechanisms for API failures
  - Helper functions for data management

#### Frontend Implementation
- Created HTML templates:
  - `base.html`: Base template with common structure and navigation
  - `index.html`: Welcome screen with options to generate names or add custom names
  - `generate.html`: Name generation interface with save/skip functionality
  - `vote.html`: Voting interface with grid layout of saved names
- Implemented CSS styling (`style.css`):
  - LEGO-inspired color scheme (red, yellow, blue)
  - Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Custom components including cards, buttons, modals, and loading indicators
  - Consistent typography and spacing
- Added JavaScript functionality (`main.js`):
  - Global notification system
  - Input sanitization helpers
  - Console logging for debugging

#### Features Implemented
- **Welcome Screen**:
  - Introduction to the application
  - Navigation to name generation
  - Modal form for adding custom team names
- **Name Generation**:
  - AI-powered team name generation using Gemini API
  - Team description generation
  - Options to save, skip, or generate new names
  - Loading indicators during API calls
- **Voting System**:
  - Display of all saved team names
  - Vote toggling functionality
  - Sorting by vote count
  - Source badges to distinguish AI vs. custom names
- **Data Management**:

#### Security Considerations
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Gemini API key stored in `config.py` (as specified)
- No user authentication required (as per requirements)

#### UI/UX Design
- Child-friendly interface with clear, readable text
- Consistent visual language across all screens
- Feedback mechanisms for user actions
- Loading states for asynchronous operations
